She is passionate about cooking from scratch, gardening, stitching, painting, and basically anything related to the creative arts and crafts.

She likes to devote time and energy to all facets of life, and can often be seen pottering and tinkering around the house fixing things that are not broken!

She is as she describes “a girl with a plan”.
