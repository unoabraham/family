Rajiv Abraham Nela is the first born child of Simon and Lily. 

He is a Christian, loves all things tech, is an audiophile, a foodie, a smartphone shutterbug, a geek, and an occasional blogger - though he’s trying to change that last bit with microblogging and photoblogging.

He values his faith and his personal relationship with God the Father, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit above all else.

He likes to discover new things and is always tinkering with the latest in technology.

He is an avid music listener, and spends at least a couple of hours each day listening to music, and most days those couple of hours end up becoming 10 hours.

He is a foodie, loves meat, especially chicken. He’s one for adventure in food and always open to trying out different delicacies like squid and raw sushi. Most days though KFC will keep him perfectly happy.

He is also into TV and movies, the same as everybody else.

He likes to play with the latest in automation and runs several projects on the Raspberry Pi and a Linux server and has a bevy of pretty ladies around the house who go by the name of Alexa and Ok Google.
